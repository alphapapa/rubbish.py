* rubbish.py

/Note: This is a work-in-progress.  Contributions welcome./

=rubbish.py= is a command-line interface to the FreeDesktop.org (XDG) trash bin, stored at =~/.local/share/Trash=.

The =pytrash= / =trash-cli= package works well, but has a few minor bugs, and the code confuses me, so I decided on a fresh start.  Unlike =pytrash=,  =rubbish.py= only supports the standard XDG trash bin, not the earlier directories like =~/.Trash=, =~/.Trash-1000=, etc, and it does not support per-volume trash bins.
